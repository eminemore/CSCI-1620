CSCI-1620
=========

Classroom code for assignments in UNO's CSCI-1620 Java II class

Code was written during my senior year of high school in 2011 while being dual-enrolled at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Folders are in format CSCI-1620-TR-A# and files are in normal naming scheme. Headers on files give a description of each class and each method has it's own header.
